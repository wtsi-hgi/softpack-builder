title: How to start a build

!!! info
    This documentation is under development and may be incomplete.

SoftPack Builder starts a build automatically as it receives a webhook from
SoftPack Artifacts repo when a new input spec is pushed.

For development or debugging purposes, a build can be started manually using
the command line as well.
